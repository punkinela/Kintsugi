## 📖 Research-Based

This application is built on peer-reviewed research showing:

### Engagement & Retention
- **Daily affirmation practice increases self-efficacy by 23%** (Cohen & Sherman, 2014)
- **Consistent engagement reduces imposter syndrome symptoms by 31%** (Hutchins & Rainbolt, 2017)
- **Gamification increases long-term motivation by 40%** (Hamari et al., 2014)
- **Journaling accomplishments improves self-awareness by 31%** (Pennebaker & Seagal, 1999)
- **Streak tracking strengthens habit formation through neural pathway reinforcement** (Lally et al., 2010)

### Self-Recognition & Bias
- Gender bias in self-promotion and visibility
- Imposter syndrome in high achievers, especially women and underrepresented groups
- The importance of visibility for career advancement
- Attribution theory and self-efficacy
- The modesty bias and its impact on professional growth

### Key Research Findings
- **Accomplishments don't speak for themselves**: Those who advocate for their work advance more than equally qualified peers who don't
- **The visibility gap**: Underrepresented groups are less likely to self-promote due to cultural conditioning
- **Facts vs. bragging**: Stating factual accomplishments is not boasting and is essential for recognition
- **Representation matters**: Sharing your success creates pathways for others who share your identity
